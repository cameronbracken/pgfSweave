Please see the README directory for development info

--------------------------
Version 1.0.4 - 2009-01-23
--------------------------
* Check for PGF > 2.00 on startup or fail to load
* Fixes for examples in vignette

--------------------------
Version 1.0.3 - 2009-12-24
--------------------------
* Fix bug where externalization did not work if pdf and eps were not
  explicitly set to FALSE. Thanks to Rasmus Pank for bringing this to my
  attention.
* Better help for pgfsweave-script.R
* Better install script for command line interface

--------------------------
Version 1.0.0 - 2009-10-14
--------------------------
* First CRAN Release
* The new package tikzDevice is now used by default instead of eps2pgf.  The 
  pgf option is still available but the use of tikzDevice is reccommended.
* Updates to the vignette
* ChangeLog now generated by git when vignette is compiled
* Fixes to get pgfsweave-script.R to run on windows (Thanks Yihui, for the 
  report)
* Caching is now more aggressive, sometime manual removal of images is 
  required, this is still preferable to the old mechanism which could be too
  conservative and recompile graphics when not needed

--------------------------
Version 0.7.2 - 2009-06-22
--------------------------
* Thanks to Charlie's ingenuity, pgfSweave now creates a symlink in $RHOME/bin 
  to pgfsweave-script.R upon source installation.  The result is that 
  `R CMD pgfsweave` 
  can now be used to compile!
* New git repo for experimental features:
  http://github.com/cameronbracken/pgfSweave/

--------------------------
Version 0.7.1 - 2009-04-30
--------------------------
* A new R script is available in the exec directory for compiling from the 
  command line.  This script uses the getopt package to parse command line 
  options.  Type 'pgfsweave-script.R --help' for more details.
* R version 2.9.0 introduces a useKerning option to the postscript device. 
  With kerning enabled, the conversion to pgf causes long strings to get 
  broken up creating large ugly gaps in the middle of words.  pgfSweave now 
  checks to see if R >= 2.9 is running and turns off kerning by default. 
* New ChangeLog generated with svn2cl
* More work on vignette

--------------------------
Version 0.7.0 - 2009-02-19 
--------------------------
* Vignette is somewhat complete
* Robust shell script for compiling in exec/ directory
* Project now also on r-forge 
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/pgfsweave/), 
  code is still tracked on rforge.net
* Tagged version 0.6, current version in trunk is 0.7

--------------------------
Version 0.6 - 2009-01-11
--------------------------
* pgfSweave added to rforge.net (http://www.rforge.net/pgfSweave/)
* Tagged version 0.5, current version in trunk is 0.6 previous versions were
  internal
