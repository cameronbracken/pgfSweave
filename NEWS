Please see the README.md file for development info

--------------------------
Version 1.2.1 - 2011-04-03
--------------------------
* [NEW] If PGF 2.10 is not available, issue a startup message but still load 
        the package (So the package can go on CRAN). PGF 2.10 is still 
        required to compile .tex file produced with pgfSweave
* [NEW] Remove null device code which could cause problems with grid graphics
* [NEW] Example using xelatex for external graphics
* [CHANGED] Fix the internal caching of external graphics, it now works as 
        expected and can save significant time

--------------------------
Version 1.2.0 - 2011-02-21
--------------------------
* [NEW] Use the tikz externalization library instead of the pgf backend. This 
        allows for more flexibility and faster compilations but BEWARE, this 
        requires at least pgf 2.10 and may break backward computability in 
        some cases 
* [NEW] GNU Make is now a system requirement for externalizing graphics, 
        NOT for compiling the package
* [NEW] Option to specify number of processors when externalizing graphics
* [NEW] Externalized graphics now have another layer of crude caching
* [NEW] Highlighted output is now output in a separate environment to fix the 
        centering issues
* [NEW] Example document using plain latex and the tikz external library to 
        generate eps graphics, `inst/example/pgfSweave-latex-example.Rnw`
* [CHANGED] The command line interface is now much simpler internally and uses 
        optparse instead of getopt for more flexibility (the optparse package
        is now a dependency)
* [CHANGED] The `tex.driver' option has been removed, the same effect can be 
        achieved using the tikz externalization library, see the new 
        example for how
* [DEPRECIATED] The `pgf' option is depreciated, please use the `tikz' option

--------------------------
Version 1.1.3 - 2011-01-07
--------------------------
* [NEW] Use the "null device" to avoid generation of Rplots.pdf, as suggested 
        by yihui, fixes Issue 8
* [NEW] New Vignette, courtesy of Hans Ekbrand! Focuses on the use of 
        pgfSweave with large data sets 
* [NEW] Example using caching by Yihui, inst/example/caching.Rnw
* [NEW] Inline comments are now preserved thanks to changes in the 
        tidy.source() function from the formatR package 
* [NEW] The formatR package is now a dependency of pgfSweave
* [FIXED] Reusing code chunks now works as expected, fixes Issue 9
* [FIXED] Links to tidy.source now correctly point to formatR

--------------------------
Version 1.1.2 - 2010-12-17
--------------------------
* Remove extraneous browser() call
* Correctly find arch dependent Rscript when installing command line interface
* Dont fail on installation when user has hardcoded working directory

--------------------------
Version 1.1.1 - 2010-12-03
--------------------------
* Actually make Highlight TRUE by default, as advertised

--------------------------
Version 1.1 - 2010-11-29
--------------------------
* New chunk option `highlight' for automatic highlighting of echo'd source 
  code.  This option is enabled by default when echo=T.
* New chunk option `tidy' which turns on the tidying of source code via the
  tidy.source function from the animation package. This feature was enabled 
  by default (with no option to do otherwise) in earlier releases. Now it 
  must be turned on explicitly. 
* A \pgfrealjobname command is added if it does not exist similarly to the 
  the addition of the \usepackage{Sweave} line.
* keep.source now works again correctly and can be used with highlighting

--------------------------
Version 1.0.11 - 2010-11-17
--------------------------
* Setting tex.driver=latex will now (in addition to working) generate an 
  eps file
* The global option `keep.blank.line' is respeceted to access the tidy.source 
  option of the same name

--------------------------
Version 1.0.10 - 2010-11-03
--------------------------
* Fixed issue with echo'd code in R 2.12.0

--------------------------
Version 1.0.9 - 2010-09-14
--------------------------
* Nicer printing of options in pgfsweave-script.R

--------------------------
Version 1.0.8 - 2010-09-06
--------------------------
* New code chunk option `sanitize', a boolean value which accesses the tikz() 
  option of the same name (Requested by Yihui Xie)
* Updated documentation

--------------------------
Version 1.0.7 - 2010-08-17
--------------------------
* Better error messages on load when pgf is not present

--------------------------
Version 1.0.6 - 2010-08-06
--------------------------
* Incorporated changes from Yihui Xie which preserves comments in echo'd code
  when keep.source=F

--------------------------
Version 1.0.5 - 2010-04-04
--------------------------
* Unlabeled code chunks are now allowed
* Fix for building on Solaris

--------------------------
Version 1.0.4 - 2009-01-23
--------------------------
* Check for PGF > 2.00 on startup or fail to load
* Fixes for examples in vignette

--------------------------
Version 1.0.3 - 2009-12-24
--------------------------
* Fix bug where externalization did not work if pdf and eps were not
  explicitly set to FALSE. Thanks to Rasmus Pank for bringing this to my
  attention.
* Better help for pgfsweave-script.R
* Better install script for command line interface

--------------------------
Version 1.0.0 - 2009-10-14
--------------------------
* First CRAN Release
* The new package tikzDevice is now used by default instead of eps2pgf.  The 
  pgf option is still available but the use of tikzDevice is recommended.
* Updates to the vignette
* ChangeLog now generated by git when vignette is compiled
* Fixes to get pgfsweave-script.R to run on windows (Thanks Yihui, for the 
  report)
* Caching is now more aggressive, sometime manual removal of images is 
  required, this is still preferable to the old mechanism which could be too
  conservative and recompile graphics when not needed

--------------------------
Version 0.7.2 - 2009-06-22
--------------------------
* Thanks to Charlie's ingenuity, pgfSweave now creates a symlink in $RHOME/bin 
  to pgfsweave-script.R upon source installation.  The result is that 
  `R CMD pgfsweave` 
  can now be used to compile!
* New git repo for experimental features:
  http://github.com/cameronbracken/pgfSweave/

--------------------------
Version 0.7.1 - 2009-04-30
--------------------------
* A new R script is available in the exec directory for compiling from the 
  command line.  This script uses the getopt package to parse command line 
  options.  Type 'pgfsweave-script.R --help' for more details.
* R version 2.9.0 introduces a useKerning option to the postscript device. 
  With kerning enabled, the conversion to pgf causes long strings to get 
  broken up creating large ugly gaps in the middle of words.  pgfSweave now 
  checks to see if R >= 2.9 is running and turns off kerning by default. 
* New ChangeLog generated with svn2cl
* More work on vignette

--------------------------
Version 0.7.0 - 2009-02-19 
--------------------------
* Vignette is somewhat complete
* Robust shell script for compiling in exec/ directory
* Project now also on r-forge 
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/pgfsweave/), 
  code is still tracked on rforge.net
* Tagged version 0.6, current version in trunk is 0.7

--------------------------
Version 0.6 - 2009-01-11
--------------------------
* pgfSweave added to rforge.net (http://www.rforge.net/pgfSweave/)
* Tagged version 0.5, current version in trunk is 0.6 previous versions were
  internal
