* A new R script is available in the exec directory for compileing from the command line.  Type 'pgfsweave-script.R --help' for more details.
* R version 2.9.0 intruduces a useKerning option to the postscript device.  This caused long strings to get broken up in the conversion to pgf.  pgfSweave now turns off kerning by default.
