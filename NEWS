Version 0.7.2 - 2009-06-22
--------------------------
* Thanks to Charlie's ingenuity, pgfSweave now creates a symlink in $RHOME/bin 
  to pgfsweave-script.R upon installation.  The result is that 
  `R CMD pgfsweave` 
  can now be used to compile!
* New git repo for experimental features:
  http://github.com/cameronbracken/pgfSweave/

--------------------------
Version 1.0 - 2009-09-21
--------------------------
* The new package tikzDevice is now used by default instead of eps2pgf.  The 
  pgf option is still available but the use of tikzDevice is reccommended.
* Updates to the vignette
* Scrapped ChangeLog

--------------------------
Version 0.7.1 - 2009-04-30
--------------------------
* A new R script is available in the exec directory for compiling from the 
  command line.  This script uses the getopt package to parse command line 
  options.  Type 'pgfsweave-script.R --help' for more details.
* R version 2.9.0 introduces a useKerning option to the postscript device. 
  With kerning enabled, the conversion to pgf causes long strings to get 
  broken up creating large ugly gaps in the middle of words.  pgfSweave now 
  checks to see if R >= 2.9 is running and turns off kerning by default. 
* New ChangeLog generated with svn2cl
* More work on vignette

--------------------------
