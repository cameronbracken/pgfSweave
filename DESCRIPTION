      speed and quality of the Sweave output including: (1) capabilities for 
      'caching' graphics generated with Sweave on top of the caching 
      mechanisms provided by cacheSweave, (2) an interface to the tikzDevice 
      package which provides graphics with consistent font style, sizing 
      and quality as the main document and (3) Automatic highlighting of 
      echo'd source code via the highlight package. pgfSweave provides a new 
      driver for Sweave (pgfSweaveDriver) with new chunk options tikz, pgf, 
      external, sanitize and highlight on top of the cache option provided by 
      cacheSweave.
