Description:  The pgfSweave package provides capabilities for 'caching' 
      graphics generated with Sweave.  Using pgfSweave, figure labels are 
      converted to LaTeX strings so not only do they match the style of the 
      document but math can be put in labels. pgfSweave provides a new driver 
      for Sweave (pgfSweaveDriver) and new chunk options tikz, pgf and 
      external on top of the cache option provided by cacheSweave. 
      This package is built upon cacheSweave and therefore also Sweave.
