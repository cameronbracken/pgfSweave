Description: pgfSweave provides a number of improvements to the
    speed and quality of Sweave output including: (1) capabilities for
    'caching' graphics generated with Sweave on top of the caching
    mechanisms provided by cacheSweave, (2) an interface to the tikzDevice
    package which provides graphics with consistent font style, sizing
    and quality as the main document and (3) highlighting of echo'd source
    code via the highlight package. pgfSweave provides a new driver for
    Sweave (pgfSweaveDriver) with new chunk options tikz, external,
    sanitize, highlight and tidy on top of the cache option provided by
    cacheSweave.
