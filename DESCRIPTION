Description:  pgfSweave provides a number of improvements to the
      speed and quality of Sweave output including: (1) capabilities for 
      'caching' graphics generated with Sweave on top of the caching 
      mechanisms provided by cacheSweave, (2) an interface to the tikzDevice 
      package which provides graphics with consistent font style, sizing 
      and quality as the main document and (3) highlighting of echo'd source 
      code via the highlight package. pgfSweave provides a new driver for 
      Sweave (pgfSweaveDriver) with new chunk options tikz, external, 
      sanitize, highlight and tidy on top of the cache option provided by 
      cacheSweave.
